## ## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### ### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### ### Installation & Running the App

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/project-name-app.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd project-name-app
    ```

3.  **Build and run the application using Docker Compose:**
    * This single command builds the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`, installs all Node.js dependencies, and starts the application server.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    * Once the build is complete and the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    * `http://localhost:3000`

    You should see the "Hello from our new app!" message. To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `docker-compose` is running.
